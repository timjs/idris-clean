# Idris to Clean backend

A priliminary backend for [Idris](http://www.idris-lang.org/) that compiles to [Clean](http://clean.cs.ru.nl/).

## Example

```
$ cat pythagoras.idr
module Main

pythagoras : Int -> List (Int, Int, Int)
pythagoras max = [
    (x, y, z)
    | z <- [1..max]
    , y <- [1..z]
    , x <- [1..y]
    , x * x + y *y == z * z
  ]

main : IO ()
main = do
  [_, n] <- getArgs
  printLn $ pythagoras (cast n)
$ idris --codegen clean pythagoras.idr -o pythagoras.icl
$ clm -b -I ../Libraries/ pythagoras

## Purpose

The purpose of this backend is to see if the [Clean programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_(programming_language)), but especially the [ABC machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_(programming_language)#The_ABC-Machine) are a good fit for Idris.

Clean is a general purpose, pure, lazy functional programming language, similar to [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), with lots of high level features.
It's the fastest lazy language out in the wild that I know of :wink:.
The ABC machine is an abstract machine to close the gap between high level functional languages and low level machine code.
The four main parts of the machine are a _graph store_, containing _nodes_ (or _closures_) to be rewritten to normal form, and three stacks:

- The **A**ddress or **A**rgument stack: holding references to nodes in the graph store.
- The **B**asic value stack: holding basic values like `Int`s, `Char`s, `Real`s and `Bool`s.
- The **C**ontrol stack: holding return addresses for control flow.

The code generator for the ABC machine developed at the [Software Science group](http://www.sws.cs.ru.nl/) of the [Radboud University](http://www.ru.nl/icis) generates fast code for Intel (64-bit and 32-bit) and ARM (32-bit only) on Windows, Linux and macOS.

First tests show that this backend is __3 to 4 times faster__ than Idris' current C backend (on my 2012 MacBook Air).
This is _without_ any optimisations like unboxed `Bool`s, `Int`s and `Real`s that Clean and ABC use heavily.
Clean's native version of the [Pythagoras benchmark](Benchmarks/pythagoras.idr) runs one order of magnitude faster, so there is a lot to win here!

## Usage

### Installing

To test the code generator, clone this repository and run `cabal`.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/timjs/idris-clean
$ cd idris-clean
$ cabal install
```

This should download all dependencies (including Idris itself).

In the mean time (compiling Haskell takes a long time...) install Clean from ftp://ftp.cs.ru.nl/pub/Clean/builds/.
Download a `clean-classic-<your-platform>-<todays-date>.tgz` tarball (nothing with `itasks` in it), unpack and run `make`.
Don't forget to append `clean/bin/` and `clean/lib/exe/` to your `$PATH`.

```shell
$ tar -xzf clean-classic-<your plafrom>-<todays-date>.tgz
$ cd clean
$ make
$ export PATH <path to clean>/bin/:<path to clean>/lib/exe/:$PATH
```

### Running

To compile an Idris file with the Clean backend run Idris with the `--codegen clean` argument and run `clm` (Clean's make utility) on the generated clean file.
Do not forget to add the `Libraries/` directory to Clean's search path!

```shell
$ idris --codegen clean <filename.idr> -o <filename.icl>
$ clm -b -I <path to idris-clean>/Libraries/ <filename WITHOUT extension> -o <executable>
```

Alternatively you can run the `idris-codegen-clean` utility on any already generated `.ibc` file and run `clm` afterwards.

```shell
$ idris-codegen-clean <filename.idr> -o <excecutable>
$ clm -b -I <path to idris-clean>/Libraries/ <filename WITHOUT extension> -o <executable>
```

### Testing

To run the tests or benchmarks build the files inside `Tests\` or `Benchmarks\` using [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/).

```shell
$ cd Tests
$ ninja
```

## Enjoy!

This is experimental software and contains BUGS!
Not all features of Idris are already implemented.
Some known bugs/limitations:

- `BigInt`s are implemented as native ABC `Int`s and are **not checked on overflow**.
- Updates are not implemented
- No FFI
- No unboxing
